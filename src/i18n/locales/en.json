    "step3Content": "To capture an opponent's piece, jump OVER it diagonally.\n\nThe square behind the captured piece must be empty.\n\nThe captured piece is removed from the board.\n\nIMPORTANT: Capture is MANDATORY! If you can capture, you must.",

    "step4Content": "If after a capture you can make another, you MUST continue.\n\nA multiple capture counts as one move.\n\nCaptured pieces are removed AFTER the complete sequence.",
